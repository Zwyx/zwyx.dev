I've investigated different static site generators — SSGs — in order to set up a proper blog for this website. I've read about a lot of them, tried a few. My favourite by far is [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), the one this site is now built with.

## Quick comparaison

As I'm working on complex web apps during the day, SSGs make evening projects feel like holiday.

Still, I found that many of them require quite some tinkering before achieving desired results. In theroy, to have a quick website set up, we can start from a template. But unfortunately this is where most of the pain come from. Many templates I looked at where incomplete, old, unmaintained, or simply ugly.

Docusaurus is the one which has the best of both:

- A great template to start with.

There is [only one](https://docusaurus.io/docs/api/themes) at the moment. It has basically everything I wanted and it's very nice. So it's much better than a choice of 100 useless templates. It might be a bit of a problem for someone really not liking it... but still, wait for the next point.

- A great way to tinker and customise it.

Docusaurus provides multiple ways to customise the [styling and layout](https://docusaurus.io/docs/styling-layout), depending on what we want to change, and how deep we want to change it. From creating React components and use them in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), to the brilliant [swizzling](https://docusaurus.io/docs/swizzling) method allowing to easily cherry pick a component to wrap it or replace it (there is an example in the [Add comment system](#add-comment-system) section below).

## Setup

:::note
I will write about the choices I've made during the building of this blog. I won't detail every steps — official docs are better sources and will stay up to date.
:::

### Create a new Docusaurus project

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest your-project-name classic --typescript
```

This is all what's needed to have a complete website with dummy pages ready to be filled with content.

:::tip
If you're sick of having a new browser tab being opened everytime you run the `start` command, append `--no-open`.
:::

### Setup Prettier

[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formats Markdown well, it will be appreciated while writing blog posts.

### Set up redirect to `/blog`

I wanted the blog to be the only content of the site for the moment. But I didn't want to [make the blog base URL simply `/`](https://docusaurus.io/docs/blog#blog-only-mode), as all the post links would be in the format `<domain>/<post>`, which could potentially become annoying if I wanted to add other types of content to the site in the future.

So I kept the blog base URL `/blog` (post links are `<domain>/blog/<post>`), and I created a redirect from `/` to `/blog`.

:::info
Server-side redirects are best, but as I'm hosting the site on GitHub Pages, this isn't an option.
:::

Docusaurus provides a [plugin for client-side redirects](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/plugins/@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects):

```bash
yarn add @docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects
```

```js title="Extract from 'docusaurus.config.js'"
plugins: [
	[
		"@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects",
		/** @type {import('@docusaurus/plugin-client-redirects').Options} */
		({
			redirects: [
				{
					from: "/",
					to: "/blog",
				},
			],
		}),
	],
],
```

### Deactivate `docs`

```js title="Extract from 'docusaurus.config.js'"
presets: [
	[
		"classic",
		...
			docs: false,
```

### Add metadata

Adding the following makes links to the blog look pretty when shared.

```js title="Extract from 'docusaurus.config.js'"
presets: [
	[
		"classic",
		...
			blog: {
				blogTitle: "<Blog title>",
				blogDescription: "<Blog description>",
```

```js title="Extract from 'docusaurus.config.js'"
themeConfig:
	...
		image: "<Image path>",
```

### Activate all feed types

Just because I want all the shiny new stuff, I activated all the [types of feeds](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/blog#feed).

```js title="Extract from 'docusaurus.config.js'"
presets: [
	[
		"classic",
		...
			blog: {
				feedOptions: {
					type: "all",
					title: "<Blog title>", // By default, it's in the format `<Site name> Blog`
					description: "<Blog description>", // Same here
				},
```

### Add comment system

[Giscus](https://giscus.app/) is a great comment system powered by GitHub Discussions.

Install its React component:

```bash
yarn add @giscus/react
```

Use [giscus.app](https://giscus.app) to set up and retrieve your configuration for Giscus, then create the file `src/components/GiscusComments.tsx`:

```tsx title="src/components/GiscusComments.tsx"
import { useColorMode } from "@docusaurus/theme-common";
import useDocusaurusContext from "@docusaurus/useDocusaurusContext";
import Giscus from "@giscus/react";
import React from "react";

export default function GiscusComments() {
	const {
		siteConfig: {
			customFields: {
				giscusRepo,
				giscusRepoId,
				giscusCategory,
				giscusCategoryId,
			},
		},
	} = useDocusaurusContext();

	const { colorMode } = useColorMode();

	if (
		typeof giscusRepo !== "string" ||
		typeof giscusRepoId !== "string" ||
		typeof giscusCategory !== "string" ||
		typeof giscusCategoryId !== "string"
	) {
		return null;
	}

	return (
		<Giscus
			repo={giscusRepo as `${string}/${string}`}
			repoId={giscusRepoId}
			category={giscusCategory}
			categoryId={giscusCategoryId}
			mapping="pathname"
			strict="0"
			reactionsEnabled="1"
			emitMetadata="0"
			inputPosition="bottom"
			theme={colorMode}
			lang="en"
		/>
	);
}
```

:::tip
I used Docusaurus' [custom fields](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/api/docusaurus-config#customfields) to retrieve Giscus configuration from Docusaurus' config (itself retrieving these values using [`dotenv`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv))
:::

In order to add the Giscus component to our blog posts, we are going to use Docusaurus' swizzling method to wrap one component of the template (read about swizzling [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/next/swizzling)):

```bash
yarn run swizzle @docusaurus/theme-classic BlogPostItem --wrap
```

This command creates a new file:

```
src/theme/BlogPostItem/index.js
```

which we can directly rename to `.tsx`:

```
src/theme/BlogPostItem/index.tsx
```

:::info
Now we need to restart Docusaurus' dev server, in order for it to take the new custom component into account.
:::

This file is a wrapper for the `BlogPostItem` component. We can very easily add our new `GiscusComments` component just below it:

```tsx title="src/theme/BlogPostItem/index.tsx"
import useIsBrowser from "@docusaurus/useIsBrowser";
import GiscusComments from "@site/src/components/GiscusComments";
import BlogPostItem from "@theme-original/BlogPostItem";
import React from "react";

const POST_REGEX = /^\/blog\/.+$/;

export default function BlogPostItemWrapper(props) {
	const isBrowser = useIsBrowser();

	return (
		<>
			<BlogPostItem {...props} />

			{isBrowser && window.location.pathname.match(POST_REGEX) && (
				<>
					<div style={{ marginTop: "32px" }} />

					<GiscusComments />

					<div style={{ marginTop: "-24px" }} />
				</>
			)}
		</>
	);
}
```

:::tip Details

- We check that the `pathname` matches `/blog/...` to not show the Giscus component below all the posts on the main listing page (`/blog`).
- `isBrowser` is to prevent evaluating `window` at build time, which would creates an error.

:::

Last thing, to be done once your local testing is finish, is to add a file `giscus.json` at the root of the repository to [prevent other websites from showing your discussions](https://github.com/giscus/giscus/blob/main/ADVANCED-USAGE.md#giscusjson):

```json title="giscus.json"
{
	"origins": ["https://<your-domain>"]
}
```

Giscus will stop showing on your `localhost:3000` after this file is committed.

### Automatically deploy to GitHub Pages, Netlify, etc.

The site is deployed on very push to the `main` branch. The [code](https://github.com/Zwyx/zwyx.dev/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-website.yml) should be self-explanatory with enough knowledge on [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages).
