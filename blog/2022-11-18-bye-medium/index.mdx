I started to write on Medium a few years ago and I liked it at first. The platform is pretty.

However I gradually realised the presence of a few red flags...

<!-- truncate -->

- Despite being pretty and having a WYSIWYG editor which was actually tolerable, the compatibility with Markdown was terrible. I wasn't able to write on my device and upload on Medium, or write on Medium and move the article somewhere else. Some knacks exists, but they're cumbersome.

No interoperability

- I found the overall content on the platform to be of "meh" quality. The good articles I read on Medium are often found through an external search engine. If I stay on Medium and continue reading other articles on the same subjects, I'm not learning more. The more time I spend, the less effective learning becomes. Despite having appealing titles and thumbnails, lots of articles are barely scratching their subject, and take lots of reading time to do it.

- Around 2021, Medium stopped retributing writers having less than one hundred subscribers. People were even more searching for ways to increase their number of subscribers. This led to poorer quality, and some articles which the sole goal — more or less disguised — was the author asking "follow me and I'll follow you back".

- Then of course:

import { Image } from "@site/src/components/Image";
import mediumBloat from "./medium-bloat.jpg";

<Image src={mediumBloat} alt="Medium bloat" width="300px" withFrame>

So I didn't want to be associated with Medium anymore, and I thought I would be better by making my own space on the Internet. This is it, I'll explain next time how I did it.
