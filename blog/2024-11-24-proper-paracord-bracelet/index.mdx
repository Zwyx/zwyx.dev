This bracelet can give 1.5~2m of paracord in 10 seconds, and it's also actually nice to wear.

This is contrary to all the other ways of making paracord bracelets that I know of, which are either nice to wear but can't be undone easily (the classic "cobra" weave), or can be undone easily but are not realistically wearable every day because of how huge they are.

To make this bracelet, get about 2m of paracord and some plastic buckles that can be purchased on many online stores (read the reviews to avoid cheap fake stuff).

Once the bracelet will be finished, we'll cut the length of rope that we'll have in extra. Then, when we'll remake the bracelet after having used it, it will be important to attach the buckle in a way that one piece of rope is about 5cm longer than the other one, as shown above.

:::

Attach the female part of the buckle, then make a loop as shown below:

<Image src={bracelet02} />

Then tighten the loop:

Now starts the repetitive pattern that will be used to weave the bracelet. There are four steps:

#### 1. Make a loop:

<Image src={bracelet04} />

#### 2. Tighten it:

<Image src={bracelet05} />

#### 3. Make a loop with the other piece of rope:

<Image src={bracelet06} />

#### 4. Tighten it as well:

<Image src={bracelet07} />

Repeat steps 1 to 4, making sure to tighten all loops with equal force.

<Image src={bracelet08} />

Stop about 1cm before reaching around the wrist:

<Image src={bracelet09} />

Pull the last loop to reduce its size to a minimum without undoing it:

<Image src={bracelet10} />

Pass the same piece of rope in the male part of the buckle, as shown below:

<Image src={bracelet11} />

Using the other piece of rope, make a [strangle knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strangle_knot) around what we've just done:

<Image src={bracelet12} />

Before tightening the strangle knot, pass the end back under the knot, to make a loop:

<Image src={bracelet13} />

This is how it looks, seen from the other side:

<Image src={bracelet14} />

Using your teeth, or some pliers, tighten the strangle knot as hard as possible. This knot is strong and should hold in place for months. If it starts to become loose, just tighten it again.

:::info

If it's the first time you're making the bracelet, cut the extra length of rope and burn the ends with a lighter. Make sure to not cut too short the piece of rope that we used to make the strangle knot: the loop should be about 1cm in diameter, and there should be also about 1cm after the knot, before the end of the rope. If you don't do that and this piece of rope is cut too short, redoing the bracelet will be a bit more of a challenge as you won't have enough slack to make the strangle knot.

I have many times done, undone, redone the bracelet shown in these pictures. It's a bit tricky at first when the rope seems too short to redo the strangle knot, but it becomes easy with experience.
