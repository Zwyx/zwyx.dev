The [DDC/CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_Data_Channel#DDC/CI) standard (introduced in 1998!) allows a computer to send commands to external monitors.

For instance, we can programmatically set the brightness of all our monitors:

- install [ddcutil](https://github.com/rockowitz/ddcutil):

```bash
sudo apt install ddcutil
```

- create a shortcut associated with a script to switch between bright and dim:

```bash
if [ "$(cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness)" = "960" ]; then
	# Set laptop monitor's brightness
	echo 57984 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
	# Set external monitors' brightness
	sudo ddcutil setvcp 0x10 60
else
	echo 960 | sudo tee /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
	sudo ddcutil setvcp 0x10 0
fi
```

`0x10` is the code for `brightness`. Run `sudo ddcutil detect` to list the monitors `ddcutil` can work with, and `sudo ddcutil getvcp all` to list the features available.

:::info

Because `sudo` is required, the shortcut's command needs to use `pkexec`:

```bash
pkexec /path/to/switch-brightness.sh
```

:::

And by the way, here's another script, to switch between light and dark themes:

```bash
if [ "$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme)" = "'Yaru'" ]; then
	gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme "prefer-dark"
	gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Yaru-dark"
else
	gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme "prefer-light"
	gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme "Yaru"
fi
```
