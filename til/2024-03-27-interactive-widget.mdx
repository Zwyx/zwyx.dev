The `viewport` meta tag option `interactive-widget` allows us to choose what the browser should do with our page when some overlay elements — such as a phone on-screen keyboard — appear:

import { Image } from "@site/src/components/Image";
import libraryOfBabel from "./2024-03-27-interactive-widget-babel.webp";
import interactiveWidgetOptionComparison from "./2024-03-27-interactive-widget-visual-comparison-all.webp";

<Image
	src={interactiveWidgetOptionComparison}
	alt="interactive-widget options comparison"
	legend={
		<>
			<code>interactive-widget</code> options comparison. The difference between{" "}
			<code>resizes-visual</code> and <code>overlays-content</code> is that{" "}
			<code>resizes-visual</code> allows the user to scroll the page up to see
			the sticky element at the bottom, whereas <code>overlays-content</code>{" "}
			doesn't.
		</>
	}
/>

Chrome's default behaviour on Android, before version 108, was `resizes-content` — it is now `resizes-visual`.

For example, the [Library of Babel](https://babel.zwyx.dev/) `viewport` meta tag is now:

```html
<meta
	name="viewport"
	content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, interactive-widget=resizes-content"
/>
```

This allows the sticky pagination component to be always visible when the on-screen keyboard is open:

<div style={{ textAlign: "center" }}>

<Image
	src={libraryOfBabel}
	alt="Example on the Library of Babel"
	width={350}
	legend={
		<>
			The keyboard is{" "}
			<a
				href="https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key"
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
			>
				Thumb-Key
			</a>
			.
		</>
	}
/>

</div>

Without `interactive-widget`, scrolling down while the keyboard was open made the sticky pagination component to disappear.
